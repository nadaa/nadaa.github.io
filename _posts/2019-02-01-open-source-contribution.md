## Open source contribution

Having a degree in computer science is not enough to be a professional developer unless you know how to write code elegantly.

Two years ago, I got to know about open source contribution, and how this can help to advance my programming skills. So, I started to investigate more on how to begin contributing. I realized the first critical part is master version control. At that time, I only know Github is a place to store codes, but I don't know how to push the code there or how to update previous code ( I guess the fault is from the universities I enrolled in and professors I met across my learning path or maybe it is my fault only).

### How to put my leg into open source
There are many open source projects that are demanding contributers and it was easy to reach a couple of open source software. The biggest challenge is from where to start. I got to know the best place to start is by visiting the organization github, then from issues, look for the ones that are labeled as "first contribution" or "need help". A big advise for new commers is to select an active organization, you can discover that the date of last issue and also from the labels.
