## Open source contribution

Having a degree in computer science is not enough to be a professional developer unless you know how to write code elegantly.

Two years ago, I got to know about open source contribution, and how this can help to advance my programming skills. I started to investigate more on how to begin contributing. I realized the first critical part is to master version control. At that time, I only know the name *Github* as software storage. I don't even know about pushing or pulling code (I guess the fault is from the universities I enrolled in and the professors I met across my learning path or maybe it is my fault only).

### How to put my leg into an open source

There are many open source projects that demand contributors and it was easy to reach a couple of open source software. The biggest challenge is to find the spot. The Spot indicates from where to start and how quickly understand the written code. It is not that easy for sure. The best thing to do is reviewing issues on organization's Github, look for the ones that are labeled as "first contribution" or "need help".

- How to Select a project/ repo- how to know about the community
A valuable advice for newcomers is to select an active repo, you can discover that by noticing the date of the last issue, the labels, and the number of contributors. 

- Select a programming stack
The most critical part is to choose a software stack (programming languages) that you enjoy working on.
I am telling you this, but I was really difficult for me to land to the proper open source until I found [Outreachy] (https://www.outreachy.org/). It is an internship for women and people from unrepresentative groups. The nice fact that it is mentored, paid, and prestigious(since big companies involved in).  

## FOSS projects


## My Experiance
Outreachy program runs twice a year and all information about projects, mentors, and application are announced in the [webpage] (https://www.outreachy.org/).
I applied two times with no acceptance. The first in 2017 I contributed to [ODK] (https://opendatakit.org/) by enhancing the documentation using tools such as python, sphinx.
The second attemp is in 2018 by getting involved in [Mozilla] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) repository called Active data recipes using python.

After sending a couple of pull requests, I heared about [hacktoberfest] (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), an initiative by Digitalocean to support contribution to open source. You can get a nice t-shirt with some nice stickers yo can put on laptop. Any one can apply to hacktoberfest yearly by October, you only need to have send some pull requests to any open source projects. Today, I received mine :).
