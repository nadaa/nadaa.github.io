## Open source contribution

Having a degree in computer science is not enough to be a professional developer unless you know how to write code elegantly.

Two years ago, I got to know about open source contribution, and how this can help to advance my programming skills. So, I started to investigate more on how to begin contributing. I realized the first critical part is master version control. At that time, I only know Github is a place to store codes, but I don't know how to push the code there or how to update previous code ( I guess the fault is from the universities I enrolled in and professors I met across my learning path or maybe it is my fault only).

### How to put my leg into open source

There are many open source projects that demand contributors and it was easy to reach a couple of open source software. The biggest challenge is from where to start. I got to know the best place to start is by visiting the organization GitHub, then from issues, look for the ones that are labeled as "first contribution" or "need help". Big advice for newcomers is to select an active organization, you can discover that the date of the last issue, labels, and a number of contributors. The most critical part is to choose a software stack (programming languages) that you enjoy working on.
I am telling you this, but I was really difficult for me to land to the proper open source until I found [Outreachy] (https://www.outreachy.org/). It is an internship for women and people from unrepresentative groups. The nice fact that it is mentored, paid, and prestigious(since big companies involved in).  

Outreachy program runs twice a year and all information about projects, mentors, and application are announced in the [webpage] (https://www.outreachy.org/).
I applied two times with no acceptance. The first in 2017 I contributed to [ODK] (https://opendatakit.org/) by enhancing the documentation using tools such as python, sphinx.
The second attemp is in 2018 by getting involved in [Mozilla] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) repository called Active data recipes using python.
