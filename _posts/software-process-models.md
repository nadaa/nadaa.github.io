## Software Process Models/ life cicle

The steps used to construct a useable and high quality software

"BARRy Bohem"
sequence of decision you made determine the history of your software
systematic approach that uses different tools
questions to ask what to do next and how long it take
it is important to know which model is proper for a particular situation
small projects work with agile, large projects need rigorous approaches
The process of choosing the model is flexiable, you may choose one model for a part in the project while choosing another model for another part.


### Traditional software engineer phases

- Requirements engineer (early error discovery save effforts and money)
		requirements elecitation
        requirements analysis
        specification
        requirements validation
        management
        
- Design (high to low level)
	architecture design
    abstruct specification
    interface design
    component design
    data structure
    algo design
    
- implementation
   reduction of complixity
   anticipation of diversity
   structuring for validation
   use of external standards
   
   
- verification & validation
	unit test
    integeration test
    system test
    
- maintenance (bug report, feature request, environmental change)
	 -corrective maintenance
     - perfective maintenance
     - adaptive maintenance
     
     complex because of regression test
     
     

Models

1) Waterfall

2) Spiral

3) Evoultionary Prototyping Process

4) Rational Unified Process

5) Agile TDD( red, Green, refactor)


## Selecting the right model
Depends on :

- Requirements understanding
- Expected Lifetime
- Risk
- Schedule constraints
- Interaction with customers
- Expertise


examples
- Software control systems: Pure waterfall
Domain is well understood
No customer interaction
requirements don't change dramitlly


Midcourse Correction system
Spiral or Evolutionary prototyping
