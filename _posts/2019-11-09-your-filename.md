## SMART Topic

Being smart is good while doing a phd, smart shouldn’t mean to intellegent. For me being smart is about awareness and the ability to make good decisions in the right times. In this peice, I will write my thoughts about selecting a research topic for Researcher in general and for PHD seeker in specific.


Having a decent Research Topic is critical step in doing phd study, comming with a good one is not an easy task. I have already started my PHD and I am encountring the puzzle and an insisting question of what is my Research Topic.

In fact my Supervisors suggested me a Topic, but still I need to refine it up to become clear. I will be using SMART methodology for that. SMART is known for setting goals. I consider doing a reasearch is a Long term goal which affects personal and professional life of People. Thus, being aware of requirements and consqeuences of doing a phd is very important for each new commers PHD.


**S**pecific : a topic should be specific, at the begining the idea might be general, but you should narrow it until you reach to a clear specfic research. An idea that novel and will add to the scientific community.

**M**easurable: this aspect Comes after narrowing down your idea, you should be able to evelauate your work and measuring your progress. In other word, I should be able to build and answer questions such as How many/much do I Need?, What is the indicator to know that I am in the right track?. This might be diffecult at the first glance, and it Needs you to have a bird’s view (bird can see a whole picture from a higher distance).

**A**cheivable: a topic should be applicable in the real world. A Question to ask, can I put my thoughts in something touchable?.

**T**imely:  normally, a PHD Topic is very big, you Need to be able to divide it into small parts that can be handed within a specific time.
