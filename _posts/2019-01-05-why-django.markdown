Good technology is created to survive. You can always evaluate if the technology is successful by measuring how popular it is. This evaluation shouldn't be a win-lose process, each technology has pros and cons, and each has a strength in a specific area.
Lately, I got to know about Django. It's a web framework based on python. Django was built in 2003 by Lawrence Journal-World newspaper team, a group of programmers developed Django while refactoring their code in building the newspaper website. Django is a web framework and is constructed on a group of libraries, allowing you to build a complete web app. When we say it is a framework, means, it is a big tool, they even use the "battery included' phrase to describe it, Django includes many things needed to build an efficient, scalable, and secured web app.

## Django mertits

Below are the criteria that make Django attractive web framework

- Learnability: It's an open source with well-written documentation. Django is easy to learn, it only requires knowledge of python.
- Active community: Django has an active development community. The current release is Django2, which will be enhanced in a new release in the future.
- Opinionated: Django follows specific design patterns, Django app consists of a group of pieced (apps), there is only a certain way to glue these pieces together.
- Handling Http: Django handle HTTP requests elegantly, moreover, Django Rest Framework will make your life easier.
- Security: Django is packed with different security libraries to protect your site from the most common vulnerable attacks such as (csfr, xss, sql injection..etc)
- Admin system: Django has a manage.py utility, allowing developers to run different commands to setup Django app quickly.
- Scalability: "scalable system doesn't need to change when the size of the problem changes". Django can handle the increase of data load and the size of the app, as well as maintaining the app is affordable.
