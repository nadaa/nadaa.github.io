## Lessons 
Here are some lessons I've learned so far from life experiance.

If you encounter in any trouble, always ask people, you're not alone in this earch, and you might find people who face the same issue as you, just search for the right group and don't be afraid to ask.
Talking to people and find compassion is a great remedy of hard situations
