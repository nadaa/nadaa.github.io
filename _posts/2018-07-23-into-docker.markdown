Being either a developer or a DevOps engineer, you may have heard the term Virtualization, and now docker containers gain attract 
many industries. A good question to answer is, why should I decide between these two?
The basic answer is software shipping, you need to be able to move your software from machine to another easily and at a cheap cost.
If you own an industry, you probably have limited resources (servers, routers, disks, memories,..etc), however, you should be able to handle heavy client requests and loads. 
A reasonable solution is to run multiple applications on the same server, but how to guarantee that the applications will work seamlessly 
since they all share the same resources.
