Our beliefs are a consequence of the conclusions we make, the conclusions come from what assumptions we create. We all have different thinking mechanism which distinguishes people from each other. You may find people living in the same environment, perceiving the same data, but each one has different perspectives.

The belief system is very important for human to be secured mentally. In addition, it is a helpful decision-making tool; however, it can be dangerous and may lead to wrong decisions and conflict. Without awareness, a human tends to select what data to perceive and make decisions accordingly. We always encounter this situation when we insist on one idea without considering the other alternatives.

[Chris Argyris ]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Argyris "Chris Argyris ") illustrated the previous mental process as "The Ladder of Inference", which shows the thinking process. It starts by observing data and going upward to actions. All human been use this model to learn and derive conclusions about anything. Observation is a base step of the ladder and because of a tremendous amount of data, we select only portions of it based on what we love or bring us comfort.

Filtering data may reduce the reliability of information, but we keep moving upward. The next step is to interpret the raw data, we make assumptions by giving a meaning to what we observe. Our reasoning model relies on impression, instinct, feelings, previous experience, culture, religion,..etc.

The process goes as follows; from assumptions, we build conclusions which turn to be a belief, and we all act upon on what we believe.
Many people think that beliefs are static, but in fact, constantly moving downward and upward along the ladder may change the beliefs and enhance understanding and communication.

### Reflexive loop problem in ladder of inference

The ladder of inference may lead to a reflexive loop. It happens when we can't differentiate between our interpretation to data and the real facts.
There couple of ways to overcome the reflexive loop:

-   Being aware of the inference procedure.
-   Going down and revising assumptions, conclusions, and observing more data.
-   Understand the difference between facts and our interpretations of the data.
-   Make thoughts visible and clarify your  thinking to others
-  Questioning and ask for feedback
