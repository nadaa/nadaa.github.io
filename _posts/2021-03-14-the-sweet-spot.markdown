Many of us might imagine being a talent in any skill. When I was a kid I dreamt to be a scientist such as ŸèEinstine whenI study physics or like Alkhawrizmi when I study math. I could make myself anyone in history who did great for humanity. I remember one of my math teachers held my hands and told me that I will be a great scientist in the future. Thinking of this make me happy and motivates me to seek knowledge more and more. I haven't felt that I am a scientist although I am a doctorate student now. Still, a voice comes from inside reminding me that I can be whatever I want despite the years. 

I already read a chapter named "the sweet spot" from the talent code book by Daniel Coyle. The book targets everyone aiming to convince the reader that talent is not something we born with instead it is something we born to work on. Most of us believe that successful people are lucky and they have the ability to reach their goals easily. The author disagrees with this idea about the effortless path, he argues that is a wrong thought, talented people practice deep before reaching their final destination. The major difference between talented and normal people, the former don't stop when they fail the first time. Talented people make mistakes and learn from them. Coyle expresses the importance of deep practice, which refers to the ability to find the sweet spot or capturing the failure and work on it wisely to become skilful.
Coyle uses examples as evidence for his arguments, for examples, he illustrates the success of Brazilian soccer players by showing the deep practice in Brazilian soccer training. Brazilian players start soccer training early and in a tough way, they play with a small heavy ball in a concrete dirty land. He studied the Brazilian example thoroughly and found that practising in difficult circumstances prepare the players to succeed in a real match since the situation is more comfortable than their training.

I agree with Coyle about the role of practice to develop talent, but it is still unclear how to find the sweet spot without the dimotivation. I believe human been respond differently to failure, some for example might become dissappointed when things go wrongly. Others might love to be challenged and try again if they fail. Another missunderstanding to the deep practice is how to it is different than repitation. You may keep repeating for many times without success. Also does deep practice requires a professional trainer or someone with experience, what about persoanl training. How can someone be able to apply the deep practice in slef-based study?.
