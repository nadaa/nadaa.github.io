Today was a special day, tomorrow I will move to a village to the east of Klagenfurt, close to Solvienia. I will stay with an Austrian family for two weeks. Despite my introverted nature, which influences me to separate from the world, I want to be close with people who are close to nature. I think those people are pure more than civilized people who live in cities.

Here is the address of the farm

My goals for this experience are:
- Learn the culture of Austrian people and culture exchange
- Meet kids and play with them
- Learn the basics of german communication
- Hiking to some nearby places and climbing mountains
- Lean organic farming principles 
- Be close to nature and be increase my awareness

I am excited to start this journey, I will share my daily activities :)
