## Agent based model

A complex system unlike physical systems can't be represented using equations. Natural phenomena such as in biomedical or social interactions each consist of enormous numbers of entities that interact nonlinearly with each other and with the surrounding environment. This interaction forms an emergent behavior of the system, also each entity capable to adapt its individual behavior which consequently affects the whole behavior of the system.
