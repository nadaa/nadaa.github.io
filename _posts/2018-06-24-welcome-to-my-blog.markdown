This is my first post, it took me a long time to start blogging. It is not because I don't believe in its value, but because of lack of topics and tools.
Simply, I don't know how to start blogging, I still don't know right now.

I used to write few posts using google blogger, but I was not a consistent writer. In addition, blogging via blogger is not preserved forever as it's linked to your Gmail account. Many times I thought I may accidentally lose all my posts if something happens to the server.
Recently, I discovered [jekyll] framework, unlike WordPress, Drupal..etc, Jekyll is a static site generator, it is particularly designed as a blogging tool. Easy to install. configure, and maintain.

For those who don't know the difference between static and dynamic sites; the former uses a database to store data, the latest doesn't use a database. The content in static sites includes HTML pages and text, there may contain also media stuff.
Jekyll is a popular blog generating tool, built in ruby platform. Jekyll works as follows: you write the content using [liqued]-enhanced HTML templates, organize it into specific-named folders, then Jekyll automatically build things together and generate a website that you can deploy easily on any web server.

What is most amazing about Jekyll is, you can deploy your blog into github, for instance I have my blog online on "nadaa.github.io". Also, Jekyll has a local server, so you can test your blog completely on your machine before publishing it on github. In case you want to deploy your blog onto your domain without using GitHub, you may consider the following sites:
[Netlify],[GitLab], and [Continuos Integeration]

I will keep adding more info here while I am still learning about Jekyll, meanwhile, you can look at the following links, it will help you to establish your journey towards blogging world with Jekyll.
